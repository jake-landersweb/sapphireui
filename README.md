# SapphireUI 

A Flutter package used to build apps for SapphireNW. 

## About

The Material and Cupertino packages from the Flutter team seem to be too biased towards their perspective platforms. Material feels very Android, but the Cupertino package does not feel right on iPhones. This package was built to feel great on both platforms, pulling inspiration from both but never committing to a single platform's style identity.
